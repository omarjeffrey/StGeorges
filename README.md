The aim at the early stage is to provide a Google Maps frame, and then add in turn:

Clickable items which spawn other links or media (e.g. text, video, audio)
Walking route (GPS mapped)
Links to other handy resources

Elements for insertion of
Analytics
Advertising (for income stream if required)

And so on

Then build in Cordova for iOS and Android
