Idea is that basic host will be Wordpress (page 1)
Within that there will be contained a HTML page (page 2) with JavaScript for interactivity (possibly Angular or similar)
Then that will embed an iframe (page 3) into a map display, with custom markers for areas of interest
and code handling for events and analytics, linking to rich media
So basically the bulk of the detail about assets etc sits on page 3

I'll type up some pictures and stuff to illustrate this
